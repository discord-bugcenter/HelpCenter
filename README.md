Help Center is a Discord Bot written for the [Bug Center](https://discord.gg/eNnK7J6MFz) Discord server.
The main goal of this Bot is to give access to cool features when helping people in our programming support.

To works properly, it needs a `.env` file with `BOT_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_TOKEN` and `GIST_TOKEN` variables defined. You could also turn off some extensions if you are focused on one specific file.
